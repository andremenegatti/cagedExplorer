Title: Tools for Importing and Analyzing Data from CAGED
Description: Tools for importing and analyzing data from CAGED,
    the Brazilian General Registry of Employed and Unemployed People.
    As of now, the package focuses on data concerning the State of 
    Sao Paulo. Relying mostly on tools from the tidyverse, it reads
    txt files released by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor, joins data from
    other sources, performs data wrangling and builds some pre-defined
    plots. It also uses the tmap package to plot maps from the State of
    Sao Paulo.
